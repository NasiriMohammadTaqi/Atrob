## Client Validation
Some attributes include user side validation, follow the steps below to add it
> In **api** projects, client-side validation are not activated and will have no overhead

1. download [atob.js](/ClientJs/Atrob.js "atob.js") and add to project
2. Then add it after the jquery-validation-unobtrusive 
> I recommend adding it inside _ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml

```
